# Interface

This is the interface of the Readiness Platform. It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display a map of hazard risk indicators.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). There are instructions [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) about running and updating it.

## Running locally

Requirements:

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)


1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
2. Copy the example environment file. 
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Run the server with `yarn run start`. It will be available at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

## Styleguide

The app has a styleguide generated by [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/).

To view this styleguide, run `yarn run styleguide`, and then visit `localhost:6060`.
To build the styleguide, run `yarn run styleguide:build`. You should do this whenever you make a change to a component.

Details on documenting new components are [in the React Styleguidist docs](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/documenting.html).
