# 🔥🙂 Interface

This is the interface of the Readiness Platform. It uses [⚛️ React](https://reactjs.org/) and [🍃 Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display a map of hazard risk indicators.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). There are instructions [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) about running and updating it.
